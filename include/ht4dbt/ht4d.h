   * @param i_pitch_steps - The resolution of the "Pitch" dimension of the 4D Hough space (corresponds to the speed in the image at which the point has been moving)
   * @param i_yaw_steps - The resolution of the "Yaw" dimension of the 4D Hough space (corresponds to the direction in the image in which the point has been moving)
   * @param i_max_pixel_shift - The maximum number of pixels in either dimension the marker image is expected to move per frame
   * @param i_im_res - The initial resolution of input image. Determines the resolution of the "X" and "Y" dimensions of the Hough space. This can be updated with the updateResolution method
   * @param i_nullify_radius - Defines the side (in pixels) of the rectangle centered on an X-Y position of the Hough space inside of which matrix elements will be nullified while searching for maxima
   * @param i_reasonable_radius - Radius (in pixels) around an estimated image trajectory line, inside of which the input points will be counted for the final blinking signal retrieval
   * @param i_framerate - The initial expected framerate (in hz) of the input stream. The requisite minimum framerate must follow the Nyquist criterion for signal retrieval (more than twice the highest expected blinking frequency). This value can be changed on the fly with the updateFramerate method.
